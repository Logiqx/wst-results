## World Speed Tour

### Notes

#### Office

- Chargers set up in spare room and taped into position
- Router - set up but switched off
- Dymo printers



#### Van

- Laptop bag
  - Glasses
  - Laptop + mouse
  - Notepad + pen
  - Sharpie

- Router to be plugged into van with generator
  - The ideal is to collect data at the beach, but process it at the camp site



#### Motions

- New entrants can be assigned a motion at beach, previous name blacked out with sharpie
  - Take a note of the rider name and the motion ID
- Spares can be assigned with the previous name blacked out, ideally labelled "wing" or "kite"
  - Take a note of the rider name and the motion ID



#### Configuration

- Dummy records in motions.csv so that unallocated motions will have their data downloaded at the beach.
  - e.g. `99,724,2024-04-21,2024-04-30,ZZZ601ZZZ,TBC,TBC,TBC`



#### Todo

- Documentation

  - Command aliases

  - Daily processes

    - Download from all motions, including unused ones to avoid confusion the next day
    - Copy OAO files to Windows for faster loading
    - Assign motions to additional knights prior to download - makes life simpler and logs are clearer

    - How to use data from backup devices - e.g. Gibson, Ornvang, Mortefon, Bornemann

  - Event configuration

    - Setup of ISWC event
    - Heat naming across days and multiple fleets all having heat 1 at different times

  - Poor quality data - Mortefon, Bornemann

- Coding

  - Show individual heat results in different columns
  - Fix character encoding of Sailwave exports
  - Resolve issue with rank being different for identical results - fastest runs on Tue 23 (Laufer and Bordes) 

- Nick to send bank details to Principe

- Contact Bjorn Haacke (German Speed) about Motion Minis, to introduce Julien
