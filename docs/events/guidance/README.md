## Farrel Cup

### Device Guidance

Everyone must use a suitable GPS device during the Farrel Cup.

The Motion LCD and Motion Mini are ideal, but they are no longer being produced.

Alternatively, ESP or LISA devices may be used as they contain similar components to the Motions.

Some of the COROS and Garmin watches approved by GPS-Speedsurfing may also be used as an alternative.

Please let the timekeeper know which GPS device you intend to use by completing this Google [form](https://tinyurl.com/4yfm6w32).



### Device Setup

#### Motion GPS

Please ensure that your Motion LCD / Motion Mini is recording at 5 Hz or 10 Hz.

Somebody on-site will co-ordinate the download and sharing of OAO data from the Motions.



#### ESP or LISA

Please ensure that your ESP or LISA device is recording at 5 Hz or 10 Hz.

Please ensure that UBX files are being recorded and send them to the timekeeper at the end of the day.



#### COROS

Due to firmware issues affecting COROS watches since May 2024, it is very important that you check your firmware.

All of the different firmware versions and their suitability can be found on another page by using this [link](https://logiqx.github.io/gps-details/devices/coros/firmware/).

Important for COROS users:

- Firmware version
  - Check the suitability of your firmware and downgrade if necessary
- Satellite settings
  - Do NOT use standard GPS, just to save battery
  - Use "All Systems" or "Dual Frequency" on the newer COROS watches
  - Use "GPS, BeiDou, Galileo, QZSS" on the older COROS watches
- Activity mode
  - Do NOT use the "Windsurfing" mode because it is not using Doppler speeds
  - Use the "Speedsurfing mode" for the best quality results

Full details about COROS watch setup can be found on another page by using this [link](https://logiqx.github.io/gps-guides/guidance/coros/setup/).

When sharing your data with the timekeeper, please send the FIT file (not GPX).

If you do not know how to get the FIT file from your COROS then please use this [link](https://logiqx.github.io/gps-guides/guidance/coros/analysis/).



#### Garmin

The Garmin watches that incorporate a multi-band Airoha or Synaptics chipset are all suitable.

The full list of suitable models can be found on another page by using this [link](https://logiqx.github.io/gps-details/devices/garmin/watches/).

Important for Garmin users:

- Data recording
  - Set to "every second", rather than the Garmin default which is called “smart” recording
- Satellite Settings
  - Do NOT use standard GPS, just to save battery
  - Use "All Systems" or "All Systems + Multi-Band" for the best quality results
- Suitable App
  - Please use [APPro Windsurf](https://apps.garmin.com/apps/9567700b-6587-44be-9708-879bfc844791) for the best quality results

Full details about Garmin watch setup can be found on another page by using this [link](https://logiqx.github.io/gps-guides/guidance/garmin/setup/).

When sharing your data with the timekeeper, please send the FIT file (not GPX).

If you do not know how to get the FIT file from Your Garmin then please use this [link](https://logiqx.github.io/gps-guides/guidance/garmin/analysis/).



### Sharing of Data

Please share your file(s) with the timekeeper as soon as you get back to the camp site.

Somebody on-site will co-ordinate the download and sharing of OAO data from the Motions.

Any ESP, LISA, COROS and Garmin devices will have to be done individually.

WeTransfer is a great way to share files but WhatsApp or e-mail are also acceptable.
